/**
 * The moderation queue and the analytics dashboard, through the real stack (`IMP-111`,
 * `ADR-036`/`ADR-037`).
 *
 * **Why this exists on top of `moderation.test.js` and `analytics.test.js`.** Those suites are the
 * thorough ones and they run against a `firebase-admin` mock, where "this caller is an admin" is a
 * fact the test asserted into existence. These two endpoints are the most privileged in the
 * product — one exposes a report queue, the other the whole catalogue's figures — so the question
 * worth re-asking end to end is whether the gate holds for **tokens somebody actually signed**.
 *
 * The identity that makes this worth the runtime is `claimOnly`: a genuine Auth-Emulator token
 * **carrying `admin: true` as a custom claim**, for a user whose `users.is_admin` is `false`. It is
 * signed, it is valid, it says admin, and it must still be refused — `IMP-002`, proven against a
 * real signature rather than against a mock that was told what to return.
 *
 * The second property is one no unit test observes from outside: **a reporter's identity never
 * leaves the database.** `moderationModel` deliberately does not select `reporter_uid`, and the
 * assertion below searches the entire serialised response for the uid that did the reporting
 * rather than checking a field list — a field nobody selects today can be added tomorrow.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why every test owns its own review, and why nothing is resolved in `beforeEach`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `review_reports` is `UNIQUE (review_id, reporter_uid)` and the insert is
 * **`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`**, so an identity gets exactly one report per review *for the lifetime
 * of the database*: once it is resolved, that pair can never produce an open report again.
 *
 * The first draft of this file resolved everything in `beforeEach` for tidiness. It cost two
 * failures and, worse, one **test that passed for the wrong reason** — the privacy assertion was
 * searching an empty queue, which contains nobody's uid. So: no shared cleanup, and each test uses
 * a review nothing else touches. `global-setup` truncates and re-seeds with `RESTART IDENTITY`, so
 * these ids are the same on every run.

/**
 * The seed has exactly **three** reviews, and each carries its own place — the report route is

 * |----|-------|--------|
 * | 1  | 1     | `seed-user-uid` |
 * | 2  | 1     | `seed-other-uid` |
 * | 3  | 3     | `seed-user-uid` |
 *
 * None belongs to an E2E identity, so nobody here reports their own review — which the API refuses.
 * Three reviews and three identities give nine distinct `(review, reporter)` pairs, which is more
 * than enough for one pair per assertion.
