 * `firebase-admin` `verifyIdToken()` — the same call, on the same code path, that production makes.
 * No middleware is stubbed, no signature check is disabled, and no production file knows this suite
 * exists. `auth-emulator.js` explains why that mattered enough to be worth the machinery.
 *
 * The property under test is the one `IMP-002` was opened for:
 *
 *     "the token says admin"  ≠  "the database says admin"
 *
 * `resolveAdminStatus` treats `users.is_admin` as the authority and a Firebase custom `admin` claim
 * as no more than a cache of it. A disagreement resolves to **not** admin. The `claimOnly` identity
 * below exists solely to prove that with a genuinely signed token.

/**

 * this suite cannot test signature verification itself: a payload tampered with while keeping a
 * valid `aud`/`iss`/`exp` is *accepted* here and would be *rejected* in production.
 *
 * That was discovered by writing exactly that test and watching it fail. The assertion was wrong,
 * not the application — so the assertion was replaced rather than the code weakened, and the gap is
 * recorded here where the next reader meets it.
 *
 * **What is still genuinely verified under emulator mode**, and therefore worth asserting:
 * token structure, `aud`/`iss` matching the project, expiry — and every DB-backed authorization
 * decision, which is where this project's actual defects lived.
 *
 * Signature verification is covered instead by `auth-boundary.spec.js` (malformed and unsigned
 * tokens are rejected) and by the production guard in `env.js` that stops
 * `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST` reaching a real deployment. See `SECURITY_AUDIT` §12.2.
