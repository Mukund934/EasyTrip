/**
 * The accessibility gate (`PE-022`).
 *
 * **Why this exists, and why now.** Sprint 6.17 ran `axe-core` across seven routes once, by hand,
 * with a throwaway spec that was deleted afterwards. Four routes came back clean. Twenty sprints
 * later, re-measuring found **one** clean route: three landmark violations and a heading skip had
 * accumulated on `/places/1`, and two sign-in pages had lost their `h1`.
 *
 * Nothing regressed loudly. Every one of those arrived in a change that looked right, passed 131
 * browser journeys, and was reviewed. **A one-off audit measures a day; a gate measures every day**,
 * and the gap between those two is exactly what this file closes. The defects it found on its first
 * run are fixed in the same sprint.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * No new dependency
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `axe-core` is already in the frontend tree — `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` depends on it — so this
 * reads the bundle off disk and injects it. `@axe-core/playwright` would be a nicer API and a new
 * direct dependency for a wrapper around `axe.run()`, which `SESSION_PROTOCOL` §11.4b asks us not to
 * take without a reason.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What it gates on, and what it deliberately does not
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Everything `axe` reports, at **zero**, except the entries in `ACCEPTED` — each of which carries a
 * reason and a node count. That is the same shape as `check-secrets`' and `check-module-size`'s
 * waiver lists, and it is chosen over the easier alternatives on purpose:
 *
 *   - **Gating on `critical` only** passes today and would have caught none of the four defects
 *     above, all of which are `moderate` or `serious`.
 *   - **Disabling the `color-contrast` rule** would hide every future contrast regression to
 *     tolerate the present ones. The allowlist is per route *and* per rule, so a new contrast
 *     failure on a route that has none still fails.
 *
 * `FV-029`'s kill criterion applies to this file as much as to the feature it grew out of: *"it
 * becomes a compliance checkbox rather than a usable filter"*. A frozen allowlist that only ever
 * grows is that checkbox. The counts below are ceilings, and a route that improves should have its
 * ceiling lowered rather than left generous.

//
// **`/` used to carry `{ 'color-contrast': 1 }` and that waiver was wrong** (`BUG-057`, fixed in
// Sprint 8.55). It was never describing the page. Both nodes it covered were caught *mid-fade*: the
// "Start Exploring" button is white on `bg-primary-600`, which passes at rest, and axe was measuring
// its background as `#99c8e1`, `#a4cee4`, `#78b6d7` — a different shade on every run, because
// `#0277b4` composited at partial opacity is a different colour every frame. The settled page has no
// contrast violations at all. `scan` now waits for the animation, and the ceiling is zero.
//
// The two that remain are real, and were stable all along: `text-yellow-500` at 1.91:1 and
// `text-gray-400` at 2.53:1 on `/browse`, measured identically across eight consecutive scans.

/**
 * Fast-forward every running animation to its end state (`BUG-057`).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What was actually wrong, after two wrong answers
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `color-contrast` samples the colour that is *painted behind* the text at the instant it runs. An
 * element in the middle of an opacity fade is composited against whatever is under it, so its
 * background is **a different colour on every frame** — and the gate was sampling at a random point
 * in that fade.
 *
 * Measured on `/`, eight consecutive scans: **0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1**, with the offending
 * background reported as `#99c8e1`, `#a4cee4`, `#8cc1dd`, `#84bddb`, `#78b6d7`, `#b7d8ea` — never
 * twice the same, all of them `bg-primary-600` (`#0277b4`) part-way through a fade to opaque. The
 * same eight scans after this function: **0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0**.
 *
 * `BUG-057` had recorded two other causes and **both were wrong**, which is why they are named here
 * rather than quietly dropped:
 *
 *   - *"Unsettled images"* — the seeded Cloudinary URLs do 404, but `document.images` reported
 *     `complete` with `naturalWidth: 0` in **all ten** measurement runs, including the ones that
 *     came back clean. The images had finished failing before every single scan.
 *   - *"Shared database state"* — the flapping reproduces with `axe.spec.js` running **alone**, with
 *     nothing else having touched the catalogue.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why `prefers-reduced-motion` was not enough, though the app honours it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `_app.jsx` wraps the tree in `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">` (`IMP-082`) and this file
 * emulates the preference below, so that is not the gap. **framer-motion's `reducedMotion="user"`
 * suppresses transform and layout animations and deliberately keeps opacity ones**, on the reasoning
 * that a fade does not provoke vestibular symptoms. Correct for a reader; useless for a measurement,
 * because opacity is exactly the property that changes what `color-contrast` sees.
 *
 * `FeaturesSection` is the concrete case: `whileInView` with `staggerChildren: 0.2` over
 * `duration: 0.5`, so its button starts fading roughly 600 ms after the section scrolls into view and
 * is still fading 500 ms later — straddling exactly the window `networkidle` + `fonts.ready` +
 * 300 ms lands in.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two passes, and a loud failure rather than a quiet one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Twice, because a `whileInView` animation does not exist until its element intersects, so the first
 * pass can finish everything and a second animation still begin afterwards.
 *
 * Finite animations are fast-forwarded and infinite ones cancelled to their initial state — the same
 * rule Playwright applies for `screenshot({ animations: 'disabled' })`, adopted rather than invented.
 *
 * And if anything is still running after both passes this **throws**. A gate that cannot get a
 * settled page should say so; measuring anyway is what produced a waiver that described an animation
 * frame and then survived twenty sprints as a fact about the palette.
