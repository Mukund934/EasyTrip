/**
 * Firebase Auth Emulator lifecycle and token minting for the E2E suite (`TD-020`, `ADR-028`).
 *
 * **Why an emulator rather than a bypass.** The suite needs to act as a signed-in admin. The
 * tempting shortcuts — an env-gated test verifier in `authMiddleware`, accepting unsigned JWTs
 * outside production, or committing a throwaway service account — were all rejected in `ADR-028`.
 * The first two are a signature check with an off switch, which is the `x-user: AdminX` bypass
 * Phase 1 existed to delete; the third is a committed private key, and `SECURITY_AUDIT` §12.0
 * records what that costs.
 *
 * The emulator avoids all three. Tokens it mints are verified by the **real** `firebase-admin`
 * `verifyIdToken()` — the same call production makes, on the same code path — because the Admin
 * SDK honours `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST`. **No production code is modified, and no production
 * code knows the emulator exists.**
 *
 * That variable also disables signature verification, which is why `env.js` refuses to boot when it
 * is set with `NODE_ENV=production` (Sprint 6.4). The guard and this file are two halves of one
 * decision.
 *
 * **Graceful absence is deliberate.** When `firebase-tools` is not installed, this module reports
 * it and the authenticated specs *skip with a stated reason* rather than silently passing — an
 * unavailable dependency should look like an unavailable dependency, not like coverage.
