/**
 * Playwright configuration for the end-to-end suite (IMP-094).
 *
 * **What this layer is for, and what it deliberately is not.**
 *
 * The API suite already proves the server's contracts against a real Postgres, and the component
 * suite proves the React units and their seams. Repeating either of those through a browser would
 * be slower and prove less. This suite exists for the class of failure neither can see:
 *
 *   - a route that 404s or redirects wrongly in a real Next server
 *   - hydration mismatches (BUG-046 was exactly this, twice)
 *   - client-side state that survives a navigation, or fails to
 *   - a form that submits in jsdom but not in a browser
 *   - the frontend and backend disagreeing about a contract they each pass in isolation
 *
 * **Why `next dev` rather than a production build.** `next build && next start` is more faithful,
 * and it is already covered by its own CI job, which fails on a broken import or component. What
 * this suite needs is SSR, hydration, routing and client state — all of which `next dev` runs for
 * real — at a cost that keeps the suite runnable. A two-minute build before every E2E run is how a
 * suite stops being run. The tradeoff is recorded in `e2e/README.md`.
 *
 * **Orchestration.** `global-setup.js` provisions Postgres, applies the schema and migrations,
 * seeds deterministic fixtures, and starts the API. This config's `webServer` starts only the Next
 * server. Splitting it that way means the suite does not depend on Playwright's internal ordering
 * between `globalSetup` and `webServer`.
