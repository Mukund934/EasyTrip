/**
 * The profile endpoints — `GET/PUT /api/auth/profile` and the `checkAdmin` empty case.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** `authController.js` sat at 48.83%, and the uncovered half was not error
 * handling: `updateProfile` had **no test at all**, and `getProfile`'s provisioning branch — the one
 * that writes a row — had never run.
 *
 * `updateProfile` is where `IMP-008` was fixed, and its own comment describes the bug:
 *
 * > *"location and dob were accepted by the validator and then dropped here, so the profile form
 * > reported success while saving nothing."*
 *
 * That is the worst shape a bug can have — a 200 response, a form that clears, and nothing written.
 * It was fixed and then left with nothing holding it in place, which is the fourth time this
 * project has found a repaired defect with no regression test. Reintroducing it means deleting two
 * parameters from one query, and every existing assertion would stay green.
