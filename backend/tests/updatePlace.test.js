/**
 * `PUT /api/admin/places/:id` — the admin edit path.
 *
 * **Why this needed a file of its own.** `placeController.js` sat at 58.11% lines, and lines
 * 231–329 — essentially the whole of `updatePlace` — were the single largest uncovered block in the
 * backend. `places.test.js` touches this route once, to assert an anonymous request gets 401; the
 * handler itself had never run to completion.
 *
 * Three properties here are easy to break and expensive when broken:
 *
 * 1. **Partial update.** Every field falls back to the stored value, but *not uniformly*: `name` and
 *    `location` use `||` while `description`, `district`, `state`, `locality` and `pin_code` use
 *    `!== undefined`. So an empty description **clears** the field and an empty name **does not**.
 *    That asymmetry is deliberate — a place must always have a name — and it is invisible unless
 *    stated.
 * 2. **Orphan cleanup.** Replacing the primary image destroys the previous asset, but only *after*
 *    the new upload succeeds and only when the public_id differs. The comment records what it fixed:
 *    "editing a place's photo N times left N-1 assets paid for and unreachable."
 * 3. **A failed upload must not fail the update.** The catch keeps the existing image and lets the
 *    rest of the edit through, so a Cloudinary outage degrades to "photo unchanged" rather than
 *    "cannot edit places".
