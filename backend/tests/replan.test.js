/**
 * `FV-027` stage (b) — the replan, as a reviewable diff.
 *
 * **The assertions here are mostly about what it refuses to do**, and that is the point rather than
 * an accident. A replanner that moves things is easy; one a traveller will trust has to leave alone
 * everything it cannot justify touching, and *say so*. A wet day silently left unchanged is
 * indistinguishable from a broken feature.
 *
 * Two invariants carry the most weight:
 *
 * - **It never writes.** The endpoint is a `GET`, and the trip is re-read afterwards to prove it.
 *   Applying a proposal goes through `PUT /items/:itemId`, which gained the ability to move an item
 *   between days in Sprint 8.26 — until then these proposals could not be applied at all, and this
 *   file said otherwise (`trips.test.js` now covers the move, including its authorisation).
 * - **`FV-025` validates every candidate move** against the whole trip before it is offered. Today
 *   that filter never rejects anything, and the suite says so rather than implying otherwise: every
 *   item-level error needs a `start_time`, and only untimed items are ever moved. The service header
 *   records why it is kept anyway.
