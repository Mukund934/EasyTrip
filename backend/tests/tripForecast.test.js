 * `FV-031` and `FV-027` stage (a) end to end — from `places.setting` to a warning in the report.
 *
 * **What this suite is for, and why it is separate from `feasibility.test.js`.** That file proves
 * the *rule*: given a day carrying a sunrise, which items are in the dark. It is a pure function
 * and it deserves pure tests. This file proves the *plumbing*, which is where the rule sat inert
 * for a sprint — the engine was correct and mutation-verified, and it never once fired in
 * production, because nothing put a sunrise on a day.
 *
 * So every assertion below goes through `GET /api/auth/trips/:id/feasibility`, against a trip built
 * through the real write path, and the only thing faked is Open-Meteo itself.
 *
 * **The one that matters most is day 2.** A trip's days are ordinals (`ADR-031`), so a day's
 * calendar date is `start_date + day_number - 1` — and an off-by-one there is invisible to every
 * other test, because it still returns *a* forecast for *a* day, and sunrise moves only a minute or
 * two per day, so the wrong day is usually still plausible. That test builds a forecast whose two
 * days disagree by 100 minutes and puts the identical item on both.
