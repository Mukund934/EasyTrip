/**
 * Enumerate the routes actually mounted on an Express app, as `(method, full path)` pairs.
 *
 * **Why this walks a private API.** `app._router.stack` is not public Express. Nothing else
 * answers the question, though: the route table is assembled at import time from four routers
 * mounted at three prefixes, two of which overlap (`/api` and `/api/admin`), and the only
 * authority on what that produced is the structure Express built. Reading the route *files* back
 * would re-implement the mounting rules and then agree with itself — the tautology
 * `VERIFICATION_LEDGER` retired a whole family of scripts for.
 *
 * **Express 5 removes `_router`.** That is why `C2`'s guard was deferred in Sprint 6.9, on the
 * stated grounds that the introspection "is removed in Express 5 — which is precisely what
 * `IMP-075` upgrades". It is not: `IMP-075` names Next, Firebase, `firebase-admin` and `nodemon`,
 * and `FRAMEWORK_UPGRADE_PLAN` §4 records Express 5 as **not scheduled**, with `app.use('*')` at
 * `app.js:297` as its one concrete blocker. The coupling accepted here is to a major the project
 * is staying on deliberately, and `expectRouterIntrospection` below turns the day that stops being
 * true into a loud failure rather than a guard that silently enumerates nothing.
 *
 * **What counts as a shadow, and what does not.** The naive form of this check — "no
 * `(method, path)` declared twice" — reports five duplicates on this app, and all five are
 * correct code. `app.js:190-196` attaches per-route rate limiters through the routing API
 * (`app.post('/api/places/:id/reviews', reviewWriteLimiter)`), which Express records as a route
 * even though its handler calls `next()` and the real handler lives in a mounted router. Those are
 * layered middleware, not competing handlers.
 *
 * So the pair is split by origin. `viaRouter` marks the declarations that came from inside a
 * mounted router — the ones where a second declaration really is unreachable, because the first
 * ends the request. The top-level declarations are pinned separately by name, so the exemption
 * cannot quietly grow into a hiding place for a real duplicate.
