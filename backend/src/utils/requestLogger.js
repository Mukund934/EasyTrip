/**
 * Per-request logging (IMP-071).
 *
 * There was none. Individual controllers hand-rolled their own request lines — with their own
 * timestamp formats, and with the caller's Firebase UID or email embedded in the message
 * (`SECURITY_AUDIT` L5). This replaces all of that with one middleware that logs every request
 * once, consistently, and without recording who made it.
 *
 * **What is deliberately NOT logged:** request headers (the `Authorization` header is a usable
 * credential for the lifetime of the token), the request body (it carries review text, profile
 * fields and, on the auth routes, whatever the client sent), and any user identifier.
 *
 * Requests are correlated by `req.id` instead — a per-request id, echoed back in the
 * `x-request-id` response header. That links one user's requests to each other and to any error
 * thrown while serving them, without recording which user it was. When a report comes in, the id
 * from the response header is the lookup key.

 * Query parameters scrubbed from the logged URL.
 *
 * The URL is worth logging — knowing that `/api/places?search=hampi&page=3` was slow is most of a

 * carried identity in this codebase: `authMiddleware` used to accept `?user=` as an authentication
 * credential (removed in Phase 1). Anything that ever authenticated a request must never be logged,
 * including after it stops being honoured — logs outlive the code that wrote them.
