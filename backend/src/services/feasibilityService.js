/**
 * The itinerary feasibility engine (`FV-025`) — stages (a) and (b).
 *
 * One question, answered deterministically: **can this plan actually be completed?**
 *
 * An itinerary that reads beautifully and cannot be executed is worse than no itinerary, because it
 * fails at 2pm on day two in a place with no signal. *"Four hours in Hampi, then sunset at a point
 * 190 km away"* is a sentence that is easy to write and impossible to do.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file contains no model call, and never will
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `FUTURE_VISION.md` commits to this being **deliberately not AI**, and the reason is not
 * squeamishness about models. The moment a model is inside the validator, the validator stops being
 * something you can prove — and the entire value of this component is that its output is provable.
 * It is also, by design, the scoring oracle for the evaluation suite (`AI-006`): constraint
 * satisfaction becomes a number rather than a judgement. A number produced by a model is a
 * judgement wearing a number's clothes.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of the trip object. No database, no clock, no network — so it
 * is exhaustively testable, and so a finding can always be reproduced from the data that produced
 * it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The honesty problem, and how it is handled
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Travel time is the check with real teeth, and EasyTrip has **no routing provider** (`FV-026`
 * proposes one; `EXTERNAL_APIS.md` §4 records OpenRouteService as the approved candidate). What
 * exists today is coordinates, which give a straight line.
 *
 * So the estimate is straight-line distance inflated by a road factor, divided by an average speed
 * — and **every consumer is told that**, because a travel-time warning that looks like a
 * measurement is fabricated data with a validator's authority (`PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` Article
 * III). `ASSUMPTIONS` is returned with the result for exactly this reason, and every finding it
 * produces carries `estimated: true`.
 *
 * The direction of the error is chosen deliberately too: the road factor makes the estimate
 * *pessimistic* about distance and the speed is a regional average rather than a highway one, so
 * the engine errs toward "this is tight" rather than toward silence. A validator that misses a real
 * problem has failed; one that flags a marginal case has merely been cautious in public.
 */

/**
 * The two numbers this engine assumes, stated rather than buried.
 *
 * Returned to the caller with every result so a UI can say "estimated" truthfully, and so the
 * moment a real routing provider lands (`FV-026`) the difference is visible rather than silent.
