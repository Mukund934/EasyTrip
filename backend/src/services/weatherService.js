 * Real weather, from Open-Meteo (`IMP-110`).

 * **This replaces a fabrication.** The detail page used to render a hardcoded 24 °C "Partly cloudy"
 * with an icon path that did not exist, presented as real. `IMP-027` deleted it rather than leave
 * invented data on the page, and `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` Article III leaves no room to bring it
 * back in any form. So: real forecast or nothing, and the "nothing" case says so out loud.
 *
 * **Why Open-Meteo.** No API key, no account, and a licence that permits non-commercial use — which
 * means nothing has to be added to `.env`, nothing can leak, and the boot-time environment gate
 * (`IMP-100`) does not grow a variable that a contributor must obtain before the app runs.
 *
 * **Why it is server-side.** The browser could call this directly and skip a hop. It does not,
 * because then the cache would be per-tab (so ten visitors to one place are ten upstream requests),
 * the timeout and failure shape would be the client's problem, and there would be no single place
 * to enforce a rate limit if the provider ever asked for one. The same reasoning `AI_ROADMAP.md`
 * §0.1 applies to model calls, minus the credential.
