/**
 * Route ordering for one day of a trip (`FV-026`, stage a).
 *
 * A day that looks fine as a list can be nonsense on a map — three places in the north, one in the
 * south, then back north. Nobody notices until they are in the taxi. `FV-025` already **warns**
 * about it (`day_backtracks`, which is this item's stage (d), delivered early). This is the other
 * half: saying what a better order would be.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three constraints, each taken from the item's own kill criteria
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * **1. It proposes; it never applies.** `FV-026` says to stop if *"optimisation starts overriding
 * what the user deliberately chose"*. So this returns an order and the arithmetic behind it, and
 * the existing reorder endpoint stays the only thing that writes. The user is shown a diff and
 * decides — the same principle `FV-027` is built on.
 *
 * **2. A day with times is not ours to reorder.** When items carry `start_time`, the clock decides
 * the order; rearranging the list would contradict it, and `FV-025` would immediately flag the
 * result as `order_disagrees_with_times`. Two features fighting over the same list is worse than
 * one of them declining, so this declines and says why. That is a real limit, not a stub.
 *
 * **3. It is a heuristic, and it says so.** *"It turns into a travelling-salesman project"* is a
 * listed kill criterion, and this is where it bit. Nearest-neighbour from the first stop — and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * A 2-opt improvement pass was written, tested and **then deleted**, because it was measured. On
 * four realistic day-sized fixtures from this catalogue (five to six stops, real coordinates) it
 * improved the route by **0, 0, 0 and 4 km on totals of 640–980 km** — under half a percent, and
 * below `WORTH_SUGGESTING_KM`, so on the one fixture where it helped at all the suggestion would
 * still have been withheld. Forty lines and a float-comparison epsilon for a saving nobody would
 * ever be shown.
 *
 * That is the kill criterion working as intended rather than an argument against optimisation:
 * *"a per-day hour budget and simple clustering catch almost every real failure, and an exact
 * solver catches marginally more for ten times the cost."* Nearest-neighbour finds the ordering a
 * person would call obvious, which is the whole requirement. If a future catalogue has denser days
 * where this stops being true, the measurement above is the thing to re-run — not the assumption
 * to re-argue.
 *
 * Distances are straight-line (`feasibilityService.haversineKm`) inflated by the same road factor.
 * There is no routing provider yet; stage (b) is gated on one, and every number here is labelled
 * `estimated` for the reason Article III gives.
