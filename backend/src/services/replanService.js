/**
 * `FV-027` stage (b) — the replan, as a reviewable diff.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this is, in one sentence
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Stage (a) says *"day 2 is wet and three of its stops are outdoors."* This says *"move these two to
 * day 4, which is clear; the third cannot move because it is scheduled at 17:00."*
 *
 * **It computes a proposal and never applies one.** The item's own kill criteria say to stop if the
 * replan cannot be presented as a reviewable diff, because *"silently rewriting somebody's trip is
 * worse than having no feature at all"*. So this is a pure function reached by a `GET`, and applying
 * a proposal goes through `PUT /trips/:id/items/:itemId`, with the authorisation and validation that
 * endpoint already has. **This adds no new way to change a trip**, which is the same discipline
 * `routeOrderService` follows for reordering.
 *
 * > **Correction, Sprint 8.26.** When stage (b) shipped, this paragraph said applying went through
 * > "the endpoint that already exists" — and that endpoint **could not move an item between days**.
 * > `trip_day_id` was neither a validated field nor an updatable column, so every proposal here was
 * > unappliable and the claim was false. The gap was real and older than this feature: the workspace
 * > had no way to move an item between days at all. `updateItem` now accepts `trip_day_id`,
 * > constrained to a day of the same trip, and appends at the destination — the same placement this
 * > file *simulates* when it validates a move.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why no model, and why that is not a compromise
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `AI_ROADMAP.md`'s pipeline is *trigger → affected window → candidates → **model call** → validate
 * with `FV-025` → diff → apply*. Six of seven steps are arithmetic. The model is needed only to
 * **compose** an item nobody put in the plan; **rearranging stops the traveller already chose is not
 * composition**, and it is the case that actually happens.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `FV-025` is the acceptance test — and today it never rejects anything
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every candidate move is applied **to a copy**, the copy is run through `checkTrip`, and the move is
 * offered only if it introduces no new error.
 *
 * ⚠️ **That filter is currently unreachable, and saying so is more useful than pretending
 * otherwise.** Every item-level error the engine can raise — `items_overlap`,
 * `order_disagrees_with_times`, `insufficient_travel_time` — requires a `start_time`, and this only
 * ever moves items that have none. An untimed stop has no clock to conflict with, so **moving one
 * cannot raise the error count**. `move_would_break_another_day` therefore exists and does not fire.
 *
 * It is kept rather than deleted for two stated reasons, not out of caution:
 *
 * 1. It is the step `AI_ROADMAP.md`'s pipeline specifies (*"`FV-025` validates the revised plan"*),
 *    and removing it means re-deriving it the moment either precondition changes.
 * 2. **Both preconditions are things the roadmap intends to change.** The day a timed item becomes
 *    movable, or the day a rule appears that an untimed stop can violate — `FV-032`'s closures are
 *    the obvious candidate, since a closed day does not care what time you arrive — this filter
 *    becomes load-bearing with no new code.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no test claiming it fires**, because none can be written honestly. The
 * test that exists asserts the true property instead: an already-broken destination day does *not*
 * block a move, because an untimed stop cannot make it worse. That is what stops the obvious failure: moving a stop
 * out of the rain and into a day it cannot physically be reached on. It is also where real road
 * distance enters — `checkTravelTime` consumes `road_legs` when `tripRoutingService` attached them,
 * so a proposal validated with a key is validated against measured driving, and without one against
 * the labelled estimate. **Same code path, better evidence.**
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The three refusals
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **1. A timed item is never moved.** `trip_items` has no `completed` or `pinned` column, and this
 * deliberately does not add one — a start time is the strongest signal the schema actually carries
 * that a human chose this hour on this day. `routeOrderService` already declines a day whose items
 * have times, for the same reason: two features fighting over one plan is worse than one declining.
 * **The decline is reported, not hidden** — a traveller who cannot see why their wet day was left
 * alone will assume the feature is broken.
 *
 * **2. A day with no reading is never a destination.** Beyond the provider's seven-day horizon there
 * is no forecast, and *absence of rain in the data is not evidence of a dry day*. Moving a stop onto
 * one would be a guess wearing a recommendation's authority.
 *
 * **3. Nothing is proposed without evidence attached.** Every proposal carries the condition it is
 * moving away from and the condition it is moving toward, plus the source that supplied both.
