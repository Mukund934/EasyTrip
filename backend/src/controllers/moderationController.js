 * **Keyed on the review, not on a report id.** A review flagged by eight people is one decision;
 * resolving one of the eight would leave it in the queue with a lower count, which reads as
 * "partly handled" and is a state nobody wants to reason about.
 *
 * Note what this endpoint does **not** do: it does not delete the review. Dismissing a report and
 * removing a review are different judgements with different consequences, and one endpoint that did
 * both according to a flag would make the destructive one reachable by a typo. Removal goes through
 * the existing review delete route, which admins may now use (`ADR-036`) — one delete path, as
 * `IMP-117` insisted.
