/**
 * Who else can open this trip (`FV-007` stage (a)).

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Managing collaborators is an owner's power, and reading the list is not
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every handler here proves the caller's relationship to the trip through `tripAccessModel`, and
 * they do not all demand the same one:
 *
 *   - **Listing** needs read access. A viewer seeing who else has the trip is the same information
 *     they get from the trip itself, and hiding it would mean somebody could be added to a trip and
 *     never know who else was on it.
 *   - **Adding and removing** are owner-only. There is no `editor` yet, and even when there is, the
 *     ability to grant access is not the ability to edit an itinerary — conflating them is how a
 *     viewer eventually adds themselves an accomplice.
 *
 * The check is `roleOnTrip` rather than "did `getTrip` return something", because these handlers
 * need to distinguish *owner* from *reader*, and a read that succeeds cannot tell them apart.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A trip you cannot see and a trip that does not exist answer alike
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 404 for both, as everywhere else in this surface. Answering 403 for "exists but not yours" turns
 * every endpoint into an oracle for which trip ids are real.
