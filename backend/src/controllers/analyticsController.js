 * `GET /api/admin/analytics` (`IMP-111`, `ADR-037`).
 *
 * Admin-only. Nothing here is secret in isolation — the catalogue is public and so are the ratings —
 * but the aggregate is operational information about the product (how many users, how many trips,
 * what is unfinished), and there is no reason for it to be readable by anyone who is not running it.
 *
 * One endpoint rather than four, because the four figures are meant to be consistent with each
 * other; fetched separately they are four snapshots of a database that is being written to.
