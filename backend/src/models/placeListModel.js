 * This is deliberately **not** `listPlaces` with a small limit. A typeahead answers a different

 * they are part-way through typing — not the most relevant document. Relevance ranking alone puts
 * a place whose *description* matches strongly above one whose name simply starts with the letters
 * on screen, which reads as the box ignoring what was typed.
 *
 * So the tiers come first and `ts_rank_cd` only breaks ties inside one:
 *
 *   0 — the name STARTS with the text. "gok" → Gokarna. Always first, always what was meant.
 *   1 — the name CONTAINS it. Recovers the mid-word matching full-text search gave up
 *       (`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS`: "ampi" no longer finds Hampi) — for suggestions only, where a
 *       generous match costs a dropdown row rather than a wrong result set.
 *   2 — anything the ranked search matches: state, district, tags, description.
 *
 * **The pattern is escaped, for the same reason the tsquery is built rather than parsed.** A `%`
 * typed into the search box is a LIKE wildcard, and `%` alone would match every row at tier 0 —
 * turning "suggestions" into "the first eight places". `\` and `_` are escaped for the same reason.
 * The CTE computes it once so the WHERE and the ORDER BY provably use the identical pattern.
 *
 * Uses no pg_trgm function (`similarity`, `%`), only LIKE/ILIKE and the tsvector. `004`'s trigram
 * indexes accelerate tiers 0 and 1 when the extension is present, and the DO block there records
 * that a managed host may refuse it — so this must still be *correct* without it, merely slower.
