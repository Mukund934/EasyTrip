/**
 * Who may open a trip (`FV-007` stage (a)).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One predicate, because twenty-six of them is how one gets forgotten
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `tripModel.js` opens by explaining why every query carries `WHERE trips.user_id = $1`:
 *
 * > *That join is the authorization boundary — a handler-side check can be forgotten by the next
 * > caller, a `WHERE trips.user_id = $1` cannot.*
 *
 * Collaboration must not cost that. There are **26 ownership references across five trip models**,
 * and widening each one by hand would turn a rule that is impossible to forget into twenty-six
 * chances to write it slightly differently — which is the same failure the original comment is
 * about, arriving through the fix rather than the bug.
 *
 * So the rule is written **once**, here, as `READABLE_BY`, and composed into the queries that read a
 * trip. A caller cannot express "readable" any other way, because no other spelling of it exists.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Read only, and that is the whole of stage (a)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Nothing in the write path changes.** Every `UPDATE`, `INSERT` and `DELETE` across the trip
 * models still says `WHERE trips.user_id = $1`, and a collaborator is refused by them exactly as a
 * stranger is. That is not an oversight to be tidied later — it is what makes `role` honest: the
 * schema CHECKs `'viewer'` and only `'viewer'`, because `viewer` is the only thing the application
 * enforces (`017_trip_collaborators.sql`).
 *
 * `editor` arrives when the write path can tell the difference. Until then a trip has exactly two
 * kinds of person: the owner, who can do everything, and a viewer, who can read.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The email is a lookup key, not an address
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `addCollaborator` takes an email and resolves it against `users.email` (`UNIQUE NOT NULL`,
 * populated from the verified token on first request). **Nothing is sent.** `FV-007`'s own kill
 * criterion is an invitation flow that needs a mail provider, and this project has none; using the
 * address somebody already registered with avoids the dependency rather than escalating to it.
 *
 * The cost is stated where a reader will meet it: you can only add somebody who already has an
 * account, and `addCollaborator` returns a distinguishable `not_found` for that case so the API can
 * say so rather than failing vaguely.
 */

/**
 * The readability rule, as a SQL fragment.
 *
 * Composed into a `WHERE` with the trip id as `$1` and the caller's uid as `$2`, in that order, so
 * every call site reads identically. `EXISTS` rather than a `LEFT JOIN` because a join against a
 * table with a `UNIQUE (trip_id, user_id)` still forces the planner to prove uniqueness, and
 * because a join would silently duplicate rows the day that constraint is relaxed.

 *
 * **`null` covers both "no access" and "no such trip", deliberately.** `getTrip` already answers
 * alike for a trip that is not yours and a trip that does not exist — telling them apart is a
 * membership oracle, and the trip page says the same sentence for both.
