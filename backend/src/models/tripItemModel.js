/**
 * Everything that writes a `trip_items` row (`IMP-109`, `ADR-031`).
 *
 * **Extracted from `tripModel` in Sprint 8.26**, and the line count is what forced the question
 * rather than what answered it. The real boundary is that these four functions share a property
 * nothing else in that file has: **an item is reached through two joins, not one.** A trip is owned
 * directly; a day belongs to a trip; an item belongs to a day that belongs to a trip. Every query
 * below therefore carries `trip_items -> trip_days -> trips` and re-proves ownership at the end of
 * that chain.
 *
 * That is the rule worth keeping in one file, because it is the rule a new function here would
 * otherwise be written without. **There is deliberately no `getItem(id)` and no `updateItem(id)`** —
 * addressing a child row by its own primary key, without the trip in the query, is one refactor away
 * from writing to somebody else's itinerary, so the shape is never offered.
 */

/**
 * Add an item to a day.
 *
 * `title` is resolved from the place when one is given and no title was supplied — the item has to
 * carry its own label, because `ON DELETE SET NULL` will one day take the place away and leave the
 * row behind (`ADR-031`).

/**
 * Patch an item, scoped through its day to its trip to its owner.
 *
 * **`trip_day_id` is handled separately from the other columns, and the reason is a security one.**
 * Every column in `UPDATABLE_ITEM_COLUMNS` is inert data — a title, a note, a time. `trip_day_id` is
 * a *reference*, and the `WHERE` clause below proves that the item's **current** day belongs to this
 * trip, which says nothing whatever about the day it is being moved to. Listing it alongside the
 * others would have let a caller move their own item into a stranger's trip by naming that trip's
 * day id: authorised on the way out, unauthorised on the way in.
 *
 * So the destination is joined and constrained — `destination.trip_id = trips.id` — against the trip
 * this caller has already been proven to own. A day id from anywhere else matches nothing, zero rows
 * update, and the caller gets the same 404 they would get for an item that does not exist.
 *
 * **Position is recomputed, not carried.** An item keeps its own position number when its day
 * changes, which would drop it into the middle of the destination day's order at whatever rank it
 * happened to hold. It is appended instead — the only placement that cannot displace something the
 * user put where they wanted it, and the same placement `replanService` *simulates* when it asks
 * `checkTrip` whether a proposed move is feasible. If the two disagreed, the validation would have
 * been answering a question about a different plan.
 *
 * Added Sprint 8.26. Before it, **nothing could move an item between days** — not the workspace UI,
 * not the API — which made `FV-027`'s proposals unappliable and this file's own claim that they went
 * through "the endpoint that already exists" untrue.
