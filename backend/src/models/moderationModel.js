/**
 * One row per **reported review**, not one per report.
 *
 * That is the whole shape of the queue and it is a deliberate choice. A review reported by eight
 * people is one moderation decision, not eight — a per-report list would make a moderator read the
 * same review eight times and act on it eight times, and the eighth action would find the review
 * already gone. Grouping means the decision and the unit of work are the same thing.
 *
 * **What is deliberately not selected: `reporter_uid`.**
 *
 * `IMP-021` established that this API never exposes the identity behind a review, and the same
 * reasoning covers the identity behind a *report* — arguably more strongly, since a moderator who
 * can see who reported whom can be lobbied, and a leak would expose people who flagged abuse. A
 * moderator needs to judge the review, and the count and the reasons are what that takes. `IMP-117`
 * made the opposite call for a different question, and the distinction holds: there, the one person
 * entitled to the correlation was the author themselves.
