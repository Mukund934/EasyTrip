/**
 * Admin analytics (`IMP-111` second half, `ADR-037`).
 *
 * **The item's premise was stale and the scope is re-argued rather than followed.** `IMP-111` says
 * *"dashboard tiles with real counts replacing the four static tiles"*, and those tiles no longer
 * exist: the fabricated "last login" (`new Date()`, always "just now") was removed in Phase 3, and
 * what is on the dashboard now is navigation cards. There is nothing to replace.
 *
 * So the question became *what would an admin of this product actually use?* — and the answer is
 * not a scoreboard. Totals are the easy thing to render and the least useful thing to read: a
 * curator does not change their behaviour because the catalogue has 47 places rather than 46.
 *
 * Every figure here is therefore either **context** (how big is the catalogue, how engaged are
 * users) or **actionable** (something is missing and you are the person who can add it). The
 * actionable ones carry the ids they refer to, so a tile can link to the work rather than describe
 * it.

 * One round trip, several scalar subqueries.
 *
 * The alternative — a query per tile — is six round trips for a page that renders once, and six
 * independent snapshots of a database that is being written to. Grouping them means the numbers on
 * screen are consistent with each other, which matters when two of them are meant to sum.
