/**
 * Deterministic sample data for development and tests (IMP-095).
 *
 * Everything here is fixed: ids, ratings, timestamps, uids. Nothing is randomised and nothing is
 * derived from the clock, because a fixture that changes between runs turns a real regression into
 * "probably just the seed" — and turns a flaky test into something nobody can reproduce.
 *
 * `rating_sum` / `rating_count` on `places` are deliberately NOT set here. A trigger maintains
 * them from `place_reviews` (migration 006), so writing them by hand would seed a database whose
 * aggregates disagree with its own reviews — and would hide the trigger being missing, which is
 * exactly the bug migration 006 exists to fix.
