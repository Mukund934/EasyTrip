/**
 * The single Postgres connection pool for the server process (IMP-044).
 *
 * There were seven. Six connected via `DATABASE_URL` with *inconsistent* TLS settings — and two of
 * them (`authController`, `newsletterController`) had no `ssl` key at all, so against a host that
 * requires TLS they would fail while their neighbours worked. The seventh was this file, which read
 * an entirely different set of `POSTGRES_*` variables that nothing else sets, and was imported only
 * by `adminModel`/`userModel` — both dead code.
 *
 * Why one pool matters: each `new Pool()` maintains its own set of connections (pg defaults to 10).
 * Seven pools meant up to 70 connections from a single instance, against managed Postgres tiers that
 * often cap total connections around 60–100. Under load the app could exhaust its own database
 * before serving meaningful traffic, and the failure looks like unrelated timeouts.

/**
 * TLS policy (IMP-063, repays TD-001). Lives here and only here — which is the whole reason the
 * Phase 4 pool consolidation had to land first.
 *
 * Until this change the value was `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }` in production, which encrypts the
 * connection but verifies nothing about who is on the other end. That accepts any certificate,
 * including one an attacker presents, so it stops a passive eavesdropper and does nothing about an
 * active one — every credential and every row in transit. It was accepted knowingly in Phase 1
 * because the provider's CA was not wired up and blocking the auth fixes on TLS plumbing would have
 * been worse; the debt entry has been open since.
 *
 * The default is now verification ON in production. Two escape hatches, in order of preference:
 *
 *   DATABASE_CA_CERT — the provider's CA certificate, PEM contents. The correct answer for a
 *   managed provider that issues certificates from its own root (Supabase, Render, Heroku,
 *   DigitalOcean). Verification stays on and the chain actually resolves.
 *
 *   DATABASE_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true — restores the old behaviour explicitly, for a deployment that
 *   cannot supply a CA today. It is deliberately loud: an unverified TLS connection is a decision
 *   somebody made, and it should appear in the boot log every time rather than hiding in a default.
