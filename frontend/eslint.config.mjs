/**
 * Frontend lint configuration, flat format (`IMP-097`, migrated for Next 16 / ESLint 9).
 *
 * The `.eslintrc.js` this replaces ended with a promise: *"When the project moves to Next 15 /
 * ESLint 9 (`IMP-075`), this becomes a flat config for real."* This is that. It is also **forced**
 * rather than chosen — `next lint` was deprecated in Next 15 and **removed in 16**, taking the
 * `--dir` flag the lint script depended on with it, so `package.json` now calls `eslint` directly.
 *
 * **Root and backend deliberately stay on `.eslintrc.js`.** Both are still on ESLint 8, which does
 * not require flat config, and converting them would mean re-verifying lint across a tier this
 * change does not otherwise touch. Two config formats in one repository is a smell worth naming,
 * and it is the smaller cost — the alternative is folding an unrelated tier into a Next upgrade
 * that `FRAMEWORK_UPGRADE_PLAN` §5 says to do alone.
 *
 * `eslint-config-next@16` **ships flat config natively**, so it is imported directly rather than
 * wrapped in `FlatCompat` — the compat shim fails on it with a circular-structure error, because it
 * is trying to normalise something that is already in the target format. Every rule below is the one
 * it replaced, with its reasoning intact: a lint config that loses its comments in a format
 * migration is one nobody can argue with afterwards.

       * The React Compiler rules — **worked through, not switched off** (`BL-146`, Sprint 8.56).
       *
       * `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` v6 arrived with Next 16 and reported **37** findings across
       * seven rules. All were pre-existing; none was upgrade breakage. They were parked here for one
       * commit with the whole list written down, on the ground that a refactor of working code does
       * not belong inside a dependency upgrade. That work is now done, and **six of the seven rules
       * are back on**, so what was fixed cannot come back:
       *
       *   - **`purity`** — `PlaceCard.jsx` called `Date.now()` during render, which made a
       *     server-rendered component's output depend on *when* it rendered. On an ISR page cached
       *     for five minutes that is a hydration mismatch waiting for a day boundary: the
       *     `BUG-044`/`BUG-046` family a third time, on the axis `no-restricted-syntax` below cannot
       *     see. Fixed as `BUG-059` — the logic moved into `dateFormat.js` as a pure function
       *     taking `now`, which also pays off half of what that module's header calls "the rest of
       *     `IMP-122`".
       *   - **`immutability` ×2** — `ExploreMap.jsx` called `useMarkerLayer` *below* the two effects
       *     that used it, so both had to omit it from their dependency arrays and carry an
       *     `exhaustive-deps` waiver explaining why the rule was wrong. It was not wrong; the
       *     ordering was. Moving one call up deleted two waivers.
       *   - **`refs`** — `useDismissable.js` wrote a ref during render. The latest-ref pattern as it
       *     is usually written, correct today because this project renders synchronously, and
       *     correct *by accident*. The write is now in an effect.
       *   - **`preserve-manual-memoization` ×2** — `useSharePlace.jsx` read a property while
       *     declaring its optional form as the dependency. The optional half was the correct one:
       *     the caller invokes the hook above its own null guard, so this was a live null-dereference
       *     resting on the callbacks not firing until a click.
       *   - **`static-components`** — the one finding that was a **false positive**, and it has an
       *     inline disable at the single line it fires on rather than the rule being left off for the
       *     whole codebase. `PlaceWeather.jsx` selects one of five module-scope icons; the rule
       *     cannot tell selecting from creating.
       *   - **`globals`** — fired only in a test probe that writes to an outer variable to capture
       *     what a context published. That is what a probe is for, so the rule is on for `src` and
       *     off for `tests/` in the block below — scoped, not disabled.
