/**
 * `FV-006` stage (c) — the claim that a trip is **one surface**, asserted rather than assumed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file exists at all
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every panel on this page is already tested on its own: `feasibilityPanel`, `dayRoute`,
 * `shareTripPanel`, `duplicateTripButton`, `exportCalendarButton`, `tripWorkspacePanels`. Not one of
 * them asserts that the panel is **on the trip page**, and that is exactly what stage (c) claims:
 *
 * > *(c) the workspace UI that puts them on one surface*
 *
 * Delete `<TripNotes />` from this page and every one of those suites still passes. The notes
 * component works perfectly; nothing renders it. **A composition claim needs a composition test**,
 * and the scope's own words are the assertion list — a trip owns the itinerary, saved places, notes
 * and a checklist as first-class children of the same object.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The specific trap this guards, which the item already fell into once
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `FV-006`'s own history is the argument. Stage (a) shipped and sat unticked for many sprints while
 * the tables, the lifecycle, the controller, two pages and two suites all existed — recorded in
 * `FUTURE_VISION.md` as *"the documentation is evidence, not authority"*. Stage (c) was drifting the
 * same way: the roadmap said it "has been arriving incrementally", which is a sentence nobody can
 * check.
 *
 * After this file, that sentence is checkable, and it fails if a panel quietly stops being rendered.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is deliberately NOT asserted here
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Three of the seven children in the scope are absent on purpose**, each owned by its own item, and
 * this file must not pretend otherwise:
 *
 *   - **documents and tickets** — `BL-145`. A boarding pass is an identity document; defaulting to
 *     Cloudinary because it is already wired would choose a store for somebody's passport scan by
 *     convenience. Needs a privacy decision and an ADR, not a schema.
 *   - **expenses** — `FV-008`.
 *   - **collaborators** — `FV-007`.
 *
 * Asserting their absence would be worse than useless: it would fail the day somebody builds them,
 * which is the opposite of what a guard is for.
