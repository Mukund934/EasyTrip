/**
 * When this place is worth visiting, and who says so (`FV-028` stage a).
 *
 * **The visible-provenance half of the stage.** The columns and the admin control are the other two;
 * without this one the data would exist, be filterable, and never be attributed to anyone on the
 * page a traveller actually reads — which is the failure mode `FV-029` was built to avoid and this
 * feature inherits at lower stakes.
 *
 * Three deliberate differences from `PlaceAccessibility`, all following from the stakes:
 *
 * **It renders nothing when nothing is curated, rather than saying "not assessed".** On the
 * accessibility panel an explicit `unknown` is the point: a traveller who needs step-free access
 * must be told plainly that nobody checked, because silence reads as "fine". Here silence is
 * accurate — a missing crowd level strands nobody — and a panel repeating "not assessed" three times
 * across the whole catalogue would train people to skip the section before it ever has content.
 *
 * **The months are a phrase, not a list.** *"October to February"* is what somebody would say;
 * twelve checkboxes rendered as prose is not. The wrap across the year is the interesting case and
 * `describeMonths` handles it — a naive rendering turns one winter season into "January, February,
 * October to December", which reads as two.
 *
 * **The date is shown for the same reason it is required.** Seasonality decays: a quiet place gets
 * popular, and a crowd level from 2019 is displayed exactly as confidently as one from last week.
