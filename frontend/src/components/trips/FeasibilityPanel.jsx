/**
 * The feasibility report, shown to the person who has to execute the plan (`FV-025`, `IMP-130`).
 *
 * **Three rules the presentation has to get right, and each of them is a way this panel could
 * quietly become useless:**
 *
 * 1. **Nothing is shown until it is asked for.** A verdict that appears on load, before the trip is
 *    finished, is a verdict about a half-built plan — and a panel that is red while you are still
 *    typing is a panel people learn to ignore.
 * 2. **Errors and warnings do not look the same.** An error means the day cannot be done; a warning
 *    means it is awkward, and a traveller is allowed to want an awkward day. Painting both red
 *    teaches the reader that red sometimes means "carry on", which is exactly the lesson that makes
 *    the next real error invisible (the same reasoning as the moderation queue's 409).
 * 3. **Every estimate says it is one.** There is no routing provider: travel times come from
 *    straight-line distance, a road factor and an average speed. The engine returns its assumptions
 *    for this purpose, and this component renders them rather than hiding them behind a number that
 *    looks measured (`PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` Article III).
