/**
 * The people who can open this trip (`FV-007` stage b).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The panel says what sharing actually does, because the word promises more
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "Share" suggests collaboration, and this is not that yet: a person added here can **read** the
 * trip and nothing else. The write path is unchanged, the schema CHECKs one role, and if the
 * interface implies otherwise the first thing that happens is somebody adds a friend, tells them to
 * add a hotel, and the friend gets an error the interface never warned them about.
 *
 * So the panel states it in a sentence a traveller reads, once, above the list. `FP-012`'s rule
 * applied to a permission rather than to a heuristic: describe what it is, not what its name
 * suggests.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The limitation is surfaced where somebody meets it, not in a tooltip
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is no mail service (`017_trip_collaborators.sql`), so the address is a lookup key against
 * accounts that already exist. That is invisible until it fails, so two things carry it: the field's
 * own hint, and the API's 422 - which says *"they need an EasyTrip account"* in words, and which
 * `tripService` deliberately passes through rather than replacing with a generic fallback.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Only the owner is offered the controls, and the server does not take the panel's word for it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `your_role` comes back from the same read that returns the list, so the panel knows which it is
 * without a second request. Hiding a control is a courtesy, not a permission - a viewer who posts
 * the request anyway gets a 404, which is asserted in `tripCollaborators.test.js`.
 */

/**
 * The token is fetched per call rather than held, like every other panel here: a token captured once
 * into a prop goes stale on a workspace somebody leaves open all afternoon.
