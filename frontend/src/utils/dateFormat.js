 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This logic lived inside `PlaceCard.jsx` and read `Date.now()` **during render**, which made a
 * server-rendered component's output a function of *when* it rendered. The card ships on an ISR
 * page (`revalidate: 300`), so cached markup could say "Yesterday" while the hydrating browser
 * computed "Today" — the `BUG-044` / `BUG-046` hydration family a third time. Those two were the
 * locale and the time zone inherited from the runtime, and the rule in `eslint.config.mjs` now
 * prevents both; this one is the **clock**, which that rule cannot see.
 *
 * Taking `now` as an argument makes the function pure, which is what makes it testable at a
 * boundary instead of only near one. The caller decides where the clock comes from, and
 * `PlaceCard` reads it after mount so that the server and the first client render agree.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the fallback is `formatDateShort` and not a second opinion
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Anything older than a week is the shared formatter's answer, unchanged. `dateFormat.js`'s header
 * named `PlaceCard.jsx` as one of two modules still carrying their own date logic — *"the rest of
 * `IMP-122`"*. This is half of that debt paid: the relative branch is here now, next to the
 * absolute one, pinned to the same locale and the same zone.

 * @param {String|null|undefined} dateString
 * @param {Number} now - epoch milliseconds; injected, never read from the clock in here
