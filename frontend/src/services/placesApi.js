/**
 * Public place reads, usable from anywhere (IMP-040).
 *
 * Split from `placeService.js` along a trust boundary rather than for convenience:
 *   placesApi.js    — public, unauthenticated reads. Runs on the server and in the browser.
 *   placeService.js — everything that needs a Firebase ID token. Browser only.
 *
 * `placeService` imports `../config/firebase` at module scope, so importing it from
 * `getStaticProps` / `getServerSideProps` drags the Firebase *client* SDK into the server render
 * path — a browser auth library, initialised on the server, to fetch public rows that need no
 * identity at all.
 *
 * To be precise about what this does and does not fix: the SDK is *already* initialised during
 * SSR, because `_app` renders `AuthProvider` and several admin pages import the service directly.
 * A build with no `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables fails at `/admin/addPlace` with
 * `auth/invalid-api-key` today, and this split does not change that — it is tracked separately.
 * What the split does is keep the new server-rendered data path from deepening that coupling.
 *
 * Uses `fetch` rather than axios: it is available in both runtimes, needs no second HTTP client
 * in the browser bundle, and supports the server-only `API_URL` indirection below.
