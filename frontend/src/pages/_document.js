        {/* IMP-123 — the server-rendered content, for a client that will not run the script that
            reveals it.

            IMP-040 moved the home page and /places/[id] to getStaticProps + ISR and /browse to
            getServerSideProps so their content would be in the HTML. It is in the HTML, and then
            hidden by it: Framer Motion serialises every `motion.*` element's `initial` prop into
            the server render as an inline `opacity: 0`, and only animates to 1 once
            requestAnimationFrame runs on the client. 89 such props across 32 components. A reader
            with scripting off gets a complete document painted at zero opacity.

            This restores them and nothing else. With JavaScript on, the block is inert and every
            entrance animation runs exactly as before — which is deliberate: the animation is a
            product decision (IMP-082 already handles `prefers-reduced-motion`), and a fix that
            quietly removed it would be trading one defect for a different one.

            `transform` is reset with it because `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}` also serialises a
            `translateY`, so revealing the element without it leaves the article 20px out of place
            with nothing to animate it back.

            Inline rather than a stylesheet link: a client degraded enough to have scripting off may
            not fetch a second resource either, and a rule that arrives after the paint is a rule
            that did not help. */}
