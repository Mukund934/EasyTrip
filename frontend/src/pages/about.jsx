            EasyTrip is a travel-destination discovery platform for India. It helps you find places
            worth visiting by theme, location, season, and what other travellers actually thought.

              <li>• No bookings, payments, or live pricing — it is a discovery tool, not a travel agent.</li>
              <li>• Coverage is India-focused and curated, so it is deliberately not exhaustive.</li>
              <li>• Ratings reflect EasyTrip&apos;s own users, not aggregated third-party scores.</li>
