/**
 * Fail-fast environment validation for the frontend (IMP-100).
 *
 * Required from `next.config.js`, which Next loads for `dev`, `build` and `start` alike — so this
 * is the one place that runs before anything else regardless of how the app was started.
 *
 * Why it matters more here than on a server: every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value is **inlined into the
 * JavaScript bundle at build time**. A missing variable is not a runtime configuration problem
 * that can be fixed by restarting with the right value — it is baked into the artifact. The build
 * succeeds, deploys, and then every Firebase call fails in the browser with `auth/invalid-api-key`,
 * or every API request goes to the literal string "undefined/places". Catching it at build time is
 * the difference between a red pipeline and a broken production site.
 *
 * Severity depends on the command, and ONLY `next build` is fatal:
 *
 *   `next build`  → missing required variables THROW and stop the build. This is the only moment
 *                   that matters, because it is the only moment the values are captured.
 *   `next start`  → warn only. The bundle it serves was built earlier; these variables were baked
 *                   in then and are not read now. Failing here would block a correctly-built
 *                   artifact from starting over variables it no longer needs.
 *   `next dev`    → warn only. A newcomer who has cloned the repo and not yet filled in .env.local
 *                   should still be able to start the app and see the UI.
 *   `next lint`   → warn only. Linting is static analysis; requiring a runtime environment to run
 *                   it would mean CI has to provision credentials before it can check syntax.
 *
 * (The first version of this file threw on everything except `next dev`, which broke `next lint`
 * outright — and CI lints before it builds, so it would have failed on the lint step with an
 * error about Firebase configuration.)
 *
 * Never prints a value — only names. See backend/src/config/env.js for the same rule and why.
