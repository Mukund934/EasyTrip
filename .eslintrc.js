/**
 * Root lint configuration — the workspace files the tiers do not own (`TD-021`).
 *
 * `backend/` and `frontend/` each carry their own config and are linted by their own scripts —
 * `backend/.eslintrc.js` on ESLint 8, and, since the Next 16 upgrade, `frontend/eslint.config.mjs`
 * in flat format on ESLint 9 (`next lint` was removed in 16, so that tier had no choice).
 *
 * What nothing covered until now was everything *between* them: `e2e/`, `scripts/` and
 * `playwright.config.js`. That is roughly 600 lines of JavaScript — including the code that
 * provisions a database and starts a server — with no static checking at all.
 *
 * This is the same gap `TD-007` described (a lint config nothing loaded) and the same one Sprint
 * 6.2 closed for `frontend/tests`, where `next lint` turned out to walk only its default
 * directories. A directory nothing checks is where a mistake lives longest, and this repo has
 * already paid for that twice.
 *
 * **`root: true` and the ignore list matter.** Without them ESLint would walk up into the tier
 * configs, or this config would apply to files that already have one — two configs disagreeing
 * about the same file is worse than one config missing it.
